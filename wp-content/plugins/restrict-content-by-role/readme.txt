Restrict users with certain User Roles from accessing content and sub-content, both publicly and the WordPress Dashboard (wp-admin).

== Description ==

If you have a WordPress website with multiple users and several User Roles defined, and you wish to prevent certain User Roles from accessing certain pieces of content (and sub-content) both publicly and within `wp-admin`, then this plugin is for you.

The plugin provides the following functionality:

* A meta box to allow you to set user role permissions for content and its sub-content
* Choose if a restricted role can also view or edit that content in wp-admin
* An option to allow content, content and sub-content or just sub content to be restricted
* An option to allow a custom redirect URL (overriding default redirect URL settings)
* The ability to override parent content restrictions on sub-content (including the ability to make it public)
* Works with the CMS Tree Page View plugin
* An options page, with the following options:
 * Choose post types that the meta box should appear on
 * Option to hide restricted pages from menu (only works when using `wp_nav_menu()`)
 * Choose the roles that will appear in the meta box to be restricted
 * Define a login screen error message (if no custom redirect URL is set)
 * Set a custom redirect URL
 * Prevent users from adding child content to restricted content

2. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
